Use these guides at your own risk.</p><p>The guides we publish range from calm swimming holes, to grade V kayaking runs. The fact that an activity is listed here doesn&rsquo;t mean it is safe for you, and because rivers are always changing, it may not be safe for even the most experienced.</p><p>Enjoy the outdoors within your abilities, always be aware of new hazards, and keep the conditions in mind.</p><p><strong>The content you submit</strong></p><p>We love to know how valuable New Zealand&rsquo;s rivers are to you.
