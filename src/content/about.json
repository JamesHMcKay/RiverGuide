    "about": "<p>The purpose of the RiverGuide is to provide the largest collection of guides for freshwater recreation, while also providing a single place to access flow, rainfall and other environmental data for all of New Zealand.</p><p>The RiverGuide is an evolving <strong>guide book</strong> for all of New Zealand&rsquo;s water related activities.</p><p>By allowing you to share your experiences, we can find out just how valuable and popular freshwater recreation in New Zealand is. These insights help us to ensure our rivers are protected for future generations to enjoy.</p><p><strong>The live data we publish</strong></p><p>We provide environmental data on many New Zealand rivers. We use, with permission, data provided directly from regional councils around New Zealand. This is live, raw data and may be subject to revision.</p><p>Sometimes the data we display, such as for river flow, can be several hours old. This is because these gauges do not always send information at regular intervals to help conserve power. We query all gauges every thirty minutes (or more for the most popular gauges), so at the most we will only be thirty minutes behind the data displayed by your regional council.</p><p>We provide current weather, and limited forecasts, from a third-party weather provider. Because many of the sites we publish are in remote locations weather stations are not always nearby. If you need the most accurate weather conditions we recommend checking a number of sources before heading into the outdoors.</p>"
