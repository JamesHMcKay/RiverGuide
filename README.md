# RiverGuide

This application provides up to date and detailed information on New Zealand rivers.  This includes river flow, weather and descriptions.  Registered users can log their trips with automatically computed river flow information.

The RiverGuide front-end uses flow information from the RiverService, running at https://www.openriverdata.com and activity guides and user details from the content management system running at https://rapidsapi.herokuapp.com/.
