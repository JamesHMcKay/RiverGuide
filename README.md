# RiverGuide

https://www.riverguide.co.nz/

The purpose of the RiverGuide is to provide the largest collection of guides for freshwater recreation in New Zealand, while also providing a single place to access flow, rainfall and other environmental data.  The RiverGuide is an evolving guide book for all of New Zealand's water related activities.

By allowing users to log trips we can find out just how valuable and popular freshwater recreation in New Zealand is. These insights help us to ensure our rivers are protected for future generations to enjoy.

## Live data

This application provides up to date and detailed information on New Zealand rivers.  This includes river flow, weather and descriptions.  Registered users can log their trips with automatically computed river flow information.

The RiverGuide front-end uses flow information from the RiverService (https://github.com/JamesHMcKay/RiverService), running at https://www.openriverdata.com.
